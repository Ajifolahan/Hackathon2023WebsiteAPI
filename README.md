# Hackathon2023WebsiteAPI
This website uses REST API to get time, day, week and more at your current IP address. It also has an alarm voice feature that alerts you when your alarm rings regardless of your current tab. 

Uses JQuery, HTML and CSS.

# For Developers
In order to run this app you need to make an apikey.js class and make a variable for your API key from RAPIDAPI. Example: const APIKEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
